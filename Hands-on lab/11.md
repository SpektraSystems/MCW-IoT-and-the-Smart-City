## Exercise 10: Process cold data through an event hub

**Duration:** 25 minutes

So far we have seen the near real time analysis of data coming in from our Bus Edge device. Remember only the data being flagged as an alert is immediately being sent to IoT Hub through the Edge Stream Analytics module. The rest of the data is being stored in local storage on the Edge Device. We have configured the local Edge storage to automatically upload its data to the cloud. This module has the intelligence to know if a viable data connection is available before it does its upload, otherwise it will store all data on the device itself - perfect for disconnected scenarios. After data has been uploaded, the Edge Storage module will automatically delete the uploaded data on the device in order to regain storage space. In order to work with this data in Time Series Insights, it needs to be processed through an Event Hub.

### Task 1: Verify cold data is being received in cloud storage

1. In the Azure Portal, open the Storage Account where you created the **telemetrysink** blob container earlier in the lab.

    ![In the storage account, Blobs is selected from the left-hand menu and the telemetrysink container is highlighted in the list of containers.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image249.png 'Blob Storage Containers')

2. Select the **telemetrysink** blob to view its contents. You should see many telemetry files with the extension *.json in the list. Each of these files indicates a reading that has been uploaded by the bus1 Edge device.

    ![Cold Readings From Edge Device are stored in json files that are listed in the telemetrysink blob.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image250.png 'Listing of json files representing readings from the edge device')

### Task 2: Create an event hub to receive the cold data

1. In your resource group, locate and select the Event Hub Namespace that has the same suffix as your IoT hub.

    ![In the list of resources, select the event hub namespace that was created with the Remote Monitoring Accelerator.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image251.png 'The Event Hub Namespace Resource')

2. From the left menu, select **Event Hubs** from the Entities section. Then press the **+ Event Hub** button.

    ![Event Hubs is selected in the left menu, the + Event Hub button is hilighted above the listing of event hubs in the namespace.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image252.png 'Create a new event hub')

3. Name the event hub **colddatahub** and press the **Create** button.

    ![The create event hub form is displayed with the name populated as colddatahub.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image253.png 'Create new event hub form')

### Task 3: Add an input to Stream Analytics to pull the data in from Telemetry storage

1. Open the Stream Analytics job that shares the same suffix as your IoT Hub.

    ![In the list of resources, select the Stream Analytics job that was created from the Remote Monitoring Accelerator.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image254.png 'Stream Analytics Resource')  

2. Stop the Stream Analytics job by pressing the **Stop** button on the top of the **Overview** window.

    ![The Stream Analytics overview screen is displayed. The Stop button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image255.png 'Stop the Stream Analytics Job')

3. Once stopped, select **Inputs** from the **Job Topology** section, then press the **+ Add stream input** button.

    ![From the left-hand menu, the Inputs item is selected. In the inputs window the Add stream input button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image256.png 'Add stream input menu')

4. Select to add **Blob storage** input.

    ![The Add Stream input menu is shown with the blob storage item selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image257.png 'Add blob storage input')

5. Create the input as follows:

   a. **Input Alias**: ColdStorage

   b. Select the **Select Blob storage from your subscriptions** option.
  
   c. **Storage Account**: select the storage account that shares the same suffix as your IoT Hub.
  
   d. **Container**, select to **Use existing** and choose the **telemetrysink** container.
  
   e. Press **Save**.

### Task 4: Add an output to Stream Analytics to forward data to an Event Hub  

1. Next, from the left hand menu select **Outputs**, then select to add an **Event Hub** output.

    ![Outputs is selected from the left hand menu, and the Add button is selcted with the Event Hub item chosen from the sub menu](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image258.png 'Add stream analytics output')

2. Create the output as follows:

    a. **Output Alias**: ColdDataHub

    b. Choose the **Select Event Hub from your subscription** item.
  
    c. **Subscription**: Select the appropriate subscription.
  
    d. **Event Hub Namespace**: Select the event hub namespace that shares the same suffix as your IoT Hub.
  
    e. **Event Hub name**: Select **Use existing**, then select **colddatahub**.
  
    f. Press **Save**.

    ![The Event Output Form is displayed populated with the previous values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image259.png 'Event Output Form')

### Task 5: Modify the Stream Analytics Query to send data from storage to the event hub

1. From the left menu, select **Query**.

2. We will first define our input dataset to pull data from storage. To do this, immediately following the **WITH** keyword, insert the following:

    ```sql
    ColdData As
    (
        SELECT
            *
        FROM ColdStorage TIMESTAMP BY [timestamp]
    ),
    ```

    ![The query editor is displayed showing the cold data query directly beneath the WITH keyword.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image260.png 'Add the input query')

3. Next, we will direct all data being read from storage and send it to our Event Hub output that we defined. To do this, scroll to the end of the query and append the following:

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    INTO ColdDataHub
    FROM ColdData
    ```

    ![The query window is displayed with the above code appended to it](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image261.png 'Add the output query')

4. Save the query.

5. From the left menu, select **Overview**, then press the **Start** button to restart the stream job.

    ![The Stream Analytics Job overview screen is displayed with the Start button selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image262.png)
