## Exercise 7: Create an Azure Function to ingest critical engine alerts and store them in Cosmos DB

**Duration:** 45 minutes

The console app is a fast and effortless way to view the critical engine alerts flowing through the Service Bus Queue, but it isn't very practical for establishing any business or processing workflow. Azure Functions makes it easy to ingest messages from service Bus, because it provides a Service Bus trigger that executes the function and passes the message object as soon as it is added to the queue. The automated scalability of Azure Functions means that it will add more resources as needed to keep up with demand during peak loads, then scales the resources back down during quieter periods. Azure Functions also provides a Cosmos DB output that makes it very simple to write data to Cosmos DB, which is another massively scalable service. Since other data is already being stored in Cosmos DB, it is a natural choice for these alerts.

### Task 1: Create a new Function

1. Open the Azure Function App resource that we created earlier.

2. Select **Functions** on the left-hand menu, then select **+ Add**.

    ![The Functions App screen is displayed with the Functions menu item selected. In the functions window the + Add button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image129.png 'New function')

3. On the **New Function** blade, search for **service bus** in template list and select the **Azure Service Bus Queue trigger** template.

    ![On the Templates tab, service bus is typed in the search field. The Azure Service Bus Queue trigger is selected from the list of available templates.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image130.png)

4. In the form that follows, provide the following configuration values:

    a. **Name**: Select **BusEngineAlert**.

    b. **Service Bus connection**: Select the Root Managed Shared Access Key of the Service Bus that you created when defining the first Azure Function.

    c. **Queue name**: Enter **alert-q**

    ![In the Service Bus Queue trigger New Function form, fields are set to the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image132.png)

5. Select **Create Function**.

### Task 2: Add an Azure Cosmos DB output to the critical-alerts collection

1. From the left menu of the new **BusEngineAlert** function and select **Integration** from the left menu.

    ![The BusEngineAlert screen is shown with the Integration item selected from the left menu.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image133.png)

2. Within the function diagram, select **+ Add output** from the **Outputs** node.

    ![The function diagram is shown with the + Add output link selected from within the Outputs node.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image277.png)

3. On the **Create Output** blade, populate the form as follows:

   a. **Binding Type**: Select **Azure Cosmos DB**.

   b. **Document parameter name**: Enter **criticalAlertDocument**

   c. **Database name**: Enter **pcs-iothub-stream**

   d. **Collection name**: Enter **critical-alerts**
  
    ![The Create Output blade is shown populated with the preceding values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image276.png)

4. Beneath the **Cosmos DB account connection** select the **New** link.

5. Ensure **Azure Cosmos DB Account** is selected, and choose the Cosmos DB account that was created by the Remote Monitoring Accelerator, then select **OK**.

    ![The New Cosmos DB connection form is displayed populated with the preceding values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image134.png)

### Task 3: Modify the function code

1. Within the **BusEngineAlert** function screen, select **Code + Test** from the left menu to view the code editor.

2. The function code is responsible for storing Engine Alert data in Cosmos DB partitioned by the unique VIN value for the device. Earlier, we have already declared the **critical-alerts** collection in Cosmos DB partitioned by the VIN, so all we need to do now is to read the information from the queue and move the data over.

3. The complete code is as follows:

    ```javascript
    module.exports = function (context, alert) {
            var criticalAlertContent = JSON.stringify(alert);
            // Save the alarm to Cosmos DB
            context.bindings.criticalAlertDocument = criticalAlertContent;
            context.done();
    };
    ```

    ![The BusEngineAlert screen is shown with the Code + Test option selected from the left menu, the code replaced with the previous value, and the Save button selected from the top toolbar.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image139.png)

4. **Save** your changes.

5. View the output Logs of the function. You should see successful function completed events.

    ![Output logs display, with two success messages.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image140.png 'Output logs')

### Task 4: View data stored by the function in Azure Cosmos DB

Apply a query filter on the messages collection to view the critical engine alert messages. These messages are stored for downstream systems that are out of the scope of the lab.

1. Navigate back to your Azure Cosmos DB account. Select **Data Explorer** from the left-hand menu.

    ![Data Explorer is selected in the Azure Cosmos DB account blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image211.png 'Azure Cosmos DB account blade')

2. Press the ellipsis next to the **critical-alerts** collection under the pcs-iothub-stream database, then select **New SQL Query**.

    ![Under Collections, pcs-iothub-stream is expanded, with the critical-alerts collection selected. In a context menu the New SQL Query item is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image141.png)

3. Enter the following query, then select **Execute Query** to view the results:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM c
    ```

    ![The query window is displayed with the results display below.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image142.png 'Query 1 tab')

4. Expand the **critical-alerts** collection and select **Items**. Choose one of the items to view. You will see the full message data for the critical alert.

    ![Under Collections, ics-iothub-stream is expanded, Critical-alerts is expanded, and Items is selected. On the Items tab, a document is selected, and the message data for the critical alert displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image143.png 'Collections section')
