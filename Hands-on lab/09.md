## Exercise 9: Add a tag to IoT Edge Device Twin

In this exercise, you will create the following tag that will be saved to the device twin: Name: IsEdgeDevice, Value: Y. You will then use this tag as the basis for a new device filter in the web UI for displaying Edge devices.

### Task 1: Create the tag update job

1. Select **Device Explorer** from the left-hand menu.

2. You will see your IoT Edge device, bus1, listed with a value of No for Simulated. Check the box next to the IoT Edge device, then select **Jobs** from the top menu.

    ![Device explorer is selected from the left hand menu. In the list of devices, the checkbox next to bus1 is checked, the Jobs button at the top of the device explorer screen is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image146.png 'Devices list')

3. In the Jobs panel, select **Tag**. Enter the following configuration for the new tag:

    a. **Job Name**: edgetag

    b. Select **+ Add** tag, then enter the following values:

    - **Name**: IsEdgeDevice
    - **Value**: Y

    ![The new job form is displayed with fields set to the previously mentioned values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image147.png 'Tag job')

4. Select **Apply**.

### Task 2: Verify tag update in the device twin

1. Navigate to your IoT Hub instance in the portal.

2. Go to **IoT Edge**, then select your IoT Edge Device from the list.

3. In the device details blade, select **Device Twin** from the top.

4. You should see the new tag in the device twin. If not, try selecting the refresh button.

### Task 3: Create new IoT Edge device group

1. Switch back over to the monitoring site, then select **Manage Device Groups** on top of the page, as done earlier in the lab.

2. Select **+ Create new device group**.

3. Provide the following configuration for the new filter:

   a. **Name**: Enter **Edge Devices**

   b. **Field**: Select **Tags.IsEdgeDevice**.

   c. **Operator**: Select **= Equals**.

   d. **Value**: Enter **Y**

   e. **Type**: Select **Text**.

   ![In the new device group form, the fields are populated with the previous values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image151.png 'Create Edge Devices device group form')

4. Select **Save**.

5. Select your new filter as the device group for the dashboard.

6. Notice that only one device is reported and displayed.
