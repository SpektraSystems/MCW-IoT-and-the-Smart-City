## Exercise 8: View critical engine alerts in the IoT Remote Monitoring web interface

We also have the ability to identify critical engine alerts by defining rules in the IoT Remote Monitoring web interface.

### Task 1: View the bus data coming from IoT Edge

Navigate back to the monitoring web app. If you don't remember the path or have closed the previous browser session, the naming convention is \[your solution name\].azurewebsites.net. You may need to refresh the browser window if it has been running for some time and is unresponsive.

1. From the device groups drop down at the top of the dashboard, select **Buses**.

2. You should see additional telemetry options above the graph at the bottom of the page, indicating availability of data from the new fields that are part of the critical engine alerts. Select **engineTemperature**.

### Task 2: Define new alert rules for buses

1. Define a new rule for Buses by selecting **Rules** in the left-hand menu, then press the **New rule** button (ensure **Buses** are still the selected device group).

   ![The Rules menu item is selected from the left menu, Buses is set as the current device group filter, and the + New Rule button is highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image231.png 'Add new Rule')

2. Define the rule as follows, then press **Apply** to add the rule to the IoT Hub Stream Analytics:

   a. **Rule Name**: Engine Temperature

   b. **Description**: Alert when an Engine Temperature is above threshold

   c. **Device Group**: Select **Buses**.

   d. **Calculation**: Select **Instant**.

   e. Condition 1 **Field**: Select **engineTemperature**.

   f. **Operator**: Select **> Greater than**.

   g. **Value**: 400

   h. **Severity level**: Select **Critical**.

   ![The new rule form is displayed with the previous values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image232.png 'Add new Rule')

   ![A continuation of the new rule form populated with the previous values.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image233.png 'Add new Rule')

3. Define a second rule for Buses by adding another rule for the Engine Oil alerts, press **New Rule** and create the rule as follows, then press **Apply**:

   a. **Rule Name**: Engine Oil

   b. **Description**: Alert when an Engine Oil drops below threshold

   c. **Device Group**: Select **Buses**.

   d. **Calculation**: Select **Instant**.

   e. Condition 1 **Field**: Select **engineoil**.

   f. **Operator**: Select **< Less than**.

   g. **Value**: 20

   h. **Severity level**: Select **Critical**.

   ![The list of rules is displayed displaying both bus rules for engine oil and engine temperature.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image234.png 'Bus Rules')

4. Give it some time, and watch the count for new critical warnings based on the rules that were just created.

   ![The list of rules is displayed including the count denoting the number of times that rule has been triggered.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image234.png 'Bus rules')
