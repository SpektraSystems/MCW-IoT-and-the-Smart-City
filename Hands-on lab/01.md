## Exercise 1: Set up the IoT Remote Monitoring solution environment

**Duration:** 30 Minutes

In this exercise, you will take advantage of the 'Remote Monitoring' Microsoft Azure IoT Solution Accelerator. This accelerator will provision the components required to implement the IoT Remote Monitoring solution. This includes an Azure Resource Group, IoT Hub, Azure Storage account, App Service for hosting the monitoring web application, Device Provisioning Services, Virtual Machine, and related components that host the Function Application microservices responsible for creating, capturing, and processing IoT device messages, and a Cosmos DB instance for storing reference, alert, and telemetry data.

### Task 1: Provision the Remote Monitoring Solution

1. Open a new web browser tab, and access ``` https://www.azureiotsolutions.com ```.

2. Select the **User Icon** in the upper right corner, and sign in with your **Azure Credentials**.

    ![Sign in menu item is displayed below selected user image.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image175.png 'Sign in')

3. In the **Deploy a Microsoft solution accelerator** section, select the **Remote Monitoring** solution.

    ![A list of available Microsoft solution accelerators is displayed, the Remote Monitoring Solution is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image176.png 'Deploy the Remote Monitoring Solution')

4. This will bring you to a description screen for the Remote Monitoring Accelerator. This screen provides details surrounding the benefits of the template, the documentation, GitHub links, and the Azure Services that will be provisioned. Provisioning of these Azure Services is automated. Press the **Try Now** button to start the provisioning process.

5. The first step in provisioning the accelerator is to provide a deployment name. Enter **iot-remote-monitoring**, select the desired Azure subscription, for Deployment Options, select **C# Microservices**, then select the Azure Location nearest you. Finally, press the **Create** button.

6. The second step to provisioning the accelerator requires no intervention on your part. A checklist of provisioning steps will be displayed and is updated in real-time as they are completed. Please wait until provisioning has completed.

7. Once completed, you will be shown a success screen with a link allowing you to view your installed solution accelerator.

    ![The remote monitoring solution has completed, a link is displayed that will open the deployed remote monitoring solution.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image179.png 'Provisioning Completed')

8. Alternatively, you may access installed accelerators in your account by selecting the **My Solutions** link on the [Azure IoT Solution Accelerators website](https://www.azureiotsolutions.com). Selecting an accelerator from this list will bring you to the screen shown in the previous step, where you can follow the **Go to your solution accelerator** link.

    ![The My Solutions button is selected and a list of deployed solution accelerators for the current logged in user is displayed.The IoT Remote Monitoring Solution is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image180.png 'Listing of deployed Azure IoT Accelerators.')

9. Upon launching the Remote Monitoring accelerator, you may be prompted to consent to accessing the Azure Portal to view the resources provisioned. Simply check the **Consent on behalf of your organization** and press the **Accept** button.

    ![A Consent Dialog is displayed, and the check box for Consent on behalf of your organization is checked. The Accept button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image181.png 'Consent Dialog')

10. When the Remote Monitoring solution is loaded, it will bring you into the Dashboard view. A series of simulated devices are feeding the portal with live data that is displayed in maps, charts, and metrics.

11. Make a note of the URL of your Remote Monitoring web application - you will be utilizing this throughout this lab.

12. In the Azure Portal, you are able to see a listing of the resources provisioned to support the Remote Monitoring Accelerator solution. Access the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and log in with your Azure credentials.

13. View the resources provisioned by the accelerator by choosing **Resource Groups** in the left-hand menu, then selecting the resource group that you entered in step 5 of this exercise, **iot-remote-monitoring**.

### Task 2: Stop running device simulation in the Remote Monitoring Solution

1. Navigate to your Remote Monitoring web application by pasting the URL in a browser window.

2. When the site loads, select the **gear** icon on the upper-right corner.

3. Shift the **Flowing** switch to stop the current device simulation. We will replace the simulated devices with our own.

    ![In the Azure IoT Suite Remote Monitoring Accelerator solution, the Settings (gear) icon is selected. Simulation Data is set to Stop flowing.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image18.png 'Azure IoT Remote Monitoring window')

4. After stopping the simulation, take a moment to browse through the site. You will notice an interactive map as the centerpiece, provided by the Azure Maps service that was provisioned as part of the solution. This will display each of your IoT devices that have location information.

    a. To the left of the map is a count of the devices, as well as the number of alarms and warnings that have been triggered based on pre-configured rules. We will add custom rules later on.

    b. Directly to the right of the map is a list of system alarms for the displayed devices.

    c. Beneath the map is a flowing line chart that displays telemetry data for selected devices and data points.

    d. To the right of the chart is a list of system KPIs (key performance indicators) that shows the number of alarms by device type and whether that number is increasing or decreasing.
