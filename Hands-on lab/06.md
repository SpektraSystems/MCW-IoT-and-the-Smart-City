## Exercise 6: Run a console app to view critical engine alerts from the Service Bus Queue

As you remember, you created an Azure Service Bus Queue to ingest messages flagged as critical engine alerts. This queue is to be fed messages from the IoT Hub that match a certain criteria. In this exercise, you will create the Azure that reads the Service Bus queue one-at-a-time so you can easily view the contents of the alerts.

**Duration:** 10 minutes

### Task 1: Retrieve the Service Bus Queue Connection string

1. Once again, open your **Service Bus** instance in the Azure Portal.

2. Select **Shared access policies** from the left-hand menu.

3. Select the **RootManageSharedAccessKey** policy, then copy the **Primary Connection String** and save it for the next task.

### Task 2: Configure and execute the ReadEngineAlerts solution in Visual Studio 2019

1. Browse to the Lab-files folder containing the extracted solution files for the lab.

2. Open **ReadEngineAlerts\\ReadEngineAlerts.sln** with Visual Studio 2019.

3. Open **Program.cs** from the Solution Explorer.

4. Locate the **connectionString** variable and replace {YOUR-CONNECTION-STRING} with the Service Bus connection string that you copied in the previous task.

    ![In Solution Explorer, Program.cs is selected, and the connectionString variable is circled.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image121.png 'Solution Explorer')

5. Right-click the **ReadEngineAlerts** project in Solution Explorer, then select **Start new instance** in the **Debug** submenu.

    ![In Solution Explorer, ReadEngineAlerts is selected, and from its right-click menu, Debug and Start new instance are selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image122.png 'Solution Explorer')

6. You should start to see critical alerts flowing in to the console window.

    ![Critical alerts display with varying colors in the Console window.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image123.png 'Console window')

7. Notice that the messages are flagged as anomalous. Meaning that there is a 1 in either the enginetempanomaly, oilanomaly, or aggressivedriving properties. This is due to the filter you defined within the Stream Analytics IoT Edge module.

8. You may close the console when you are finished reviewing the data.
