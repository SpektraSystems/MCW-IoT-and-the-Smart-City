## Exercise 2: Provision additional Azure services

**Duration:** 45 minutes

Use the Azure portal to create services that will be used by the overall IoT solution environment. You will create an additional consumer group on the default messages/events IoT Hub endpoint. This will allow us to add more readers that can read the massive amounts of incoming IoT data being ingested by IoT Hub. This will help prevent conflicts from multiple readers attempting to modify the checkpoints and offsets of the partitions holding the messages. Next, you will review the already provisioned Azure Time Series Insights instance to collect, filter, and display all-time series data flowing in from your simulated IoT devices as well as your IoT Edge device. In this exercise, you will provision a service bus queue to house engine alerts, a container registry to hold the custom Vehicle Telemetry module, and additional storage account containers that are required later in the lab.

### Task 3: Review the consumer groups in the IoT Hub

In this task, you will review the consumer groups that were added to the default messages/events IoT Hub endpoint, for other Azure resources to use. A consumer group can have a single reader and keeps track of items that have already been read, and what still remains to be read. Define a consumer group for each subscriber of IoT Hub event data.

1. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the **Azure Management** portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2. Browse to the **Resource Group** that was automatically created in the previous exercise. You can find your resource groups by selecting Resource groups in the left-hand side menu on the portal.

3. Locate your **IoT Hub** within the resource group. Its name will start with "iothub-", followed by randomly generated characters.

    ![In Resource group list, the IoT Hub is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image24.png 'Resource group listing')

4. In the left-hand menu, select the **Built-in endpoints** item, this will bring up the **Events** endpoint information and consumer groups.

    ![The built-in endpoints menu item is selected, beneath the Events section, consumer groups are listed.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image221.png 'IoT Consumer Groups')

5. Create a new consumer group by typing **queuefuncconsumergroup** into a Consumer Groups text box, we will use this consumer group later on in this lab.

![The list of consumer groups is displayed, in the textbox at the end of the list, queuefuncconsumergroup is typed in.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image222.png 'IoT Hub Create Consumer Group')

   ![In the IoT Hub menu, Shared Access policies is selected. In the list of policies, iothubowner is selected, in the policy blade the copy button next to the Connection string - primary key text box is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image240.png)

### Task 4: Review the Azure Time Series Insights instance

Azure Time Series Insights is the first fully managed time series database on the Azure platform. It was developed primarily with high volume IoT data in mind, where having a single location in which you can quickly view this information and derive insights on it is typically no small feat. Although the IoT Remote Monitoring solution you provisioned stores its simulated device data in Cosmos DB, you will be able to ingest that same data into Time Series Insights, along with data generated by your IoT Edge device. This is because all data flows through IoT Hub as the initial point of ingress. You have a time series consumer group on the Events endpoint specifically for Time Series Insights to be able to simultaneously read and store the same data that will land in Cosmos DB, as well as the added IoT Edge data. After reviewing the Time Series Insights instance, you will see how it's configured to use the IoT Hub consumer group as an input.

1. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the **Azure Management** portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2. Select the resource group that you created when deploying the Remote Monitoring Accelerator. In the list of resources, select the item with the type **Time Series Insights environment**.

    ![In the list of resources, the Time Series Insights environment is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image184.png 'Time Series Insights environment')

3. Select **Event Sources** from the left-hand menu.

4. View the IoT Hub Event Source.

    ![Event Sources is selected under Environment Toplogy, and the Add button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image185.png 'Event Sources blade')

### Task 5: Provision an Azure Container Registry

IoT Edge devices use one or more modules to perform a series of actions locally on the device before sending data up to the cloud. Modules include custom modules written in a language like C\#, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Machine Learning, Azure Functions, Azure Storage, and SQL Azure. Each of these modules is hosted within a Docker container. We will be adding three modules for the IoT Edge device: a custom C\# module, an Azure Stream Analytics module, and the Storage Module. Modules are defined with all required files in a container image. The images are then pushed to a registry that stores and manages them. The final step is to deploy the images from the registry onto your IoT Edge devices. Two popular Docker registry services available in the cloud are Azure Container Registry and Docker Hub. We will be using Azure Container Registry to manage and deploy the IoT Edge modules.

1. Using a new tab or instance of your browser navigate to the **Azure Management** portal, <http://portal.azure.com>.

2. Select **+ Create a resource**, then type **container registry** into the search box on top. Select **Container Registry** from the results.

    ![The search field in the New blade displays Azure Container Registry.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image36.png 'New blade')

3. Select the **Create** button on the **Container Registry overview** blade.

4. On the **Create container registry** form, specify the following configuration options:

    a. Select the **Subscription** you used when deploying the accelerator.

    b. Select your **Resource Group**, ensuring it's the same one in which your new components have been created.

    c. **Registry Name**: Unique value for the registry name (ensure the green check mark appears).

    d. Select the same **Location** as your Resource Group and other services.

    e. Select the **Basic** SKU.

    ![The Create container registry blade displays with the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image37.png 'Create container registry blade')

5. Select **Create**.

6. After provisioning is complete, go to your new Container Registry resource and select **Access keys** from the left-hand menu.

7. Enable the **Admin user**.

8. Copy the **Login server**, **Username**, and **Password** values and save them for later.

    ![In the Container registry blade, under Settings, Access keys is selected. The copy buttons for Login server, Username, and password are all called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image38.png 'Container registry blade')

### Task 6: Obtain the Storage Account Connection String

1. Return to the Resource Group that houses the resources for the IoT Remote Monitoring solution. From the list, select the Storage account resource whose name shares the same last 5 characters as the IoT Hub name.

   ![In the list of resources, the storage account that shares the same suffix as the IoT Hub is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image241.png 'Select the Storage Account Resource')

2. From the left-hand menu, select **Access keys**, then copy the value of the Connection string of **key1**. We will be using this value later on in the lab.

    ![In the Storage Account screen, access keys is selected from the left menu. The copy button is selected next to the key1 Connection string textbox.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image242.png 'Copy the connection string for key 1')

3. Also save the name of the storage account, as we'll be needing this value later on in this lab as well.

### Task 7: Create storage account containers required for the lab

While we are in the storage account, we will need to create two blob containers for use in this lab.

1. The first container we will create is responsible for housing the definition and configuration of the Azure Stream Analytics job that we will have running on an Edge device later in this lab.

   a. From the menu to the left, scroll down to the **Blob service** section and select **Containers**.

   b. Select **+ Container** at the top of the Containers blade, then provide the following:

      - **Name**: asa-container

      - **Public access level**: Container

    ![The blobs menu item is selected in th left menu, the + Container button is displayed and a form with the previously defined fields are displayed.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image95.png 'Create blob storage container')

2. The second container will be responsible for holding the 'cold' telemetry data coming in from an Edge device. This data is a history of all telemetry gathered from an Edge device that is not uploaded to the cloud in real time.

   a. From the menu to the left, scroll down to the **Blob service** section and select **Containers**.

   b. Select **+ Container** at the top of the Containers blade, then provide the following:

      - **Name**: telemetrysink

      - **Public access level**: Container

### Task 8: Retrieve Secrets from the Key Vault

Later in this lab, we will be making use of the Azure Key Vault. This vault is created so that secrets do not need to reside in code. A Key Vault resource was generated when we created the IoT Remote Monitoring accelerator.

1. Return to the resource group that was created for this lab. In the list of resources select the Azure Key Vault resource. Record the name of the Key Vault for use later on in this lab.

    ![In the list of resources, the key vault resource is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image243.png 'Key Vault Resource')
