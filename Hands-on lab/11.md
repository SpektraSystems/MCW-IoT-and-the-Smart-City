## Exercise 11: View all data in Azure Time Series Insights

**Duration:** 15 minutes

Now that the critical engine alert data is being recorded, and we have folded in the telemetry coming in from storage to an event hub as well, we can view this data in Time Series Insights.

### Task 1: Add your account as a Contributor to the Data Access Policies

Before you can access the Time Series Insights environment and make changes, you need to make sure your account is added as a Contributor to the Data Access Policies. This is where you add additional users who can access this data. You should have already been added as a Contributor by utilizing the IoT Remote Monitoring Accelerator. If this is not the case, please follow the following steps.

1. Open your Azure Time Series Insights instance in the portal.

2. Select **Data Access Policies** from the left-hand menu.

3. If your account is not listed as a contributor, select **+ Add** from the Data Access Policies blade.

    ![The Add button is selected in the Data Access Policies blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image153.png 'Data Access Policies blade')

4. Select your user account by using the search field, then select both the **Reader** and **Contributor** roles for your user account.

    ![In the Select Role blade, the check boxes for Reader and Contributor are selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image154.png 'Select Role blade')

5. Select **Ok** twice to go back to the Data Access Policies blade. You should now see your account listed with the Reader and Contributor roles.

### Task 2: Add the cold data event hub as an event source into Time Series Insights

1. From the left-hand menu, select **Event Sources** from the **Environment Topology** section, then press the **Add** button.

    ![In the left menu, Event sources is selected, the Add button is highlighted above the list of available event sources.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image263.png 'Add event source')

2. Define the input source as follows:

   a. **Event source name**: Enter **ColdData**

   b. **Source**: Select **Event Hub**.
  
   c. **Import option**: Select **Use Event Hub from available subscriptions**.

   d. **Subscription**: Select the appropriate subscription.

   e. **Event Hub namespace**: Select the event hub namespace with the same suffix as your IoT Hub.

   f. **Event Hub name**: Select **colddatahub**.

   g. **Timestamp property name**: Enter **timestamp**

   h. Press **Create**.

> **Note**: The timestamp property is part of the telemetry data, this tells Time Series Insights how to ensure the data is arranged in the appropriate date/time order.

### Task 3: Go to the Time Series Insights environment and use the data explorer

1. Select **Overview** from the left-hand menu, then select **Go to Environment**.

    ![In the Data Access Policies blade, the Go to Environment button is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image155.png 'Data Access Policies blade')

2. The Time Series Insights data explorer will open in a new tab. By default, a chart displaying a count of all events is displayed. Notice how there is a timeline directly underneath the chart, and a more macro-level timeline below that, showing a span of several hours.

    ![A chart displays for 1 series of 1 total in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image156.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

3. Use the **Terms Editor Panel** located on the left-hand side of the screen to query your environment. Select **Add**.

    ![Add is selected in the Terms Editor Panel.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image157.png 'Terms Editor Panel')

4. The Measure drop down shows all numeric columns (Doubles), and the Split By drop down shows categorical columns (Strings). To compare voltages for the traffic lights, select **voltage** under Measure, then **serial_number** under Split By.

    ![The Measure and Split by fields are called out.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image158.png 'Measure and Split by fields')

5. You will now see the two traffic lights listed by serial number, on the same chart as the total event count. You can hover over a serial number to the left of the chart to highlight its place on the chart.

    ![This time, 3 series of 3 total display in chart format in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image159.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

6. Select the **gear** within the new measure you created, then place a check in the box next to **Use Step Interpolation** and **Show Min/Max**.

    ![The Gear icon is selected and its menu displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image160.png 'Gear icon')

7. The chart will update to reflect those changes. Notice how Show Min/Max creates a shadow behind the interpolated line to show the minimum and maximum voltage values. This is because the displayed line is the average voltage value.

    ![The described multi-dimensional chart displays in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image161.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

8. Right-click on a line on the chart and select **Explore Events**.

    ![The right-click menu displays with Explore Events selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image162.png 'Right-click menu')

9. You will see all the raw event data for the events displayed within the visible time range for the selected terms. You may select which columns you want to view and export the data if desired.

    ![The Events tab displays. Select all columns is selected, and raw data displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image163.png 'Events tab')

### Task 3: View the simulated and IoT Edge bus data side-by-side

Because all telemetry data that flows through IoT Hub is captured in Time Series Insights, it is possible to view this information in one place, creating a data context that's based on time of occurrence and any additional data points you need. In this case, we will overlay the simulated bus GPS device data from the IoT Remote Monitoring simulator, with the vehicle telemetry data generated and filtered by the bus IoT Edge device.

1. Delete the traffic light voltage query and add a new query set in the Terms Editor Panel. Select **averageenginetemperature** as the Measure, and Split By **none**. Update the Where clause with the following: vin = \'Y3J9PV9TN36A4DUB9\'.

    ![The New Query section displays with the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image164.png 'New Query section')

2. Add a new query set. Select **speed** as the measure, and **Split By** iothub-connection-device-id. Update the Where clause with the following: vin = \'Y3J9PV9TN36A4DUB9\' AND \[iothub-connection-module-id\] = NULL.

    ![The New Query section displays with the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image165.png 'New Query section')

3. The where clause ensures that the simulated bus GPS device data matches up with the bus IoT Edge device by setting the VIN for both to the same value. Since both event sources contain a "speed" field, we want to rely on the reported speed from the GPS device, as it is updated more regularly. To do this, the where clause returns only those items whose "iothub-connection-module-id" is null. Only IoT Edge devices will contain an Id in this field.

4. The chart shows both the average engine temperature and the reported bus speed from the GPS device stacked one on top of the other.

    ![This time, 3 series of 3 total graphs display in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image166.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

5. To overlay the data, hide the overall event Count in the Terms Editor Panel, use step interpolation on the IoT Edge and simulated bus queries to make it easier to see the overlaid values, then deselect the stack terms option on the chart. This view may make it easier to spot correlations between different data sets, such as this one.

    ![2 series of 2 total graphs display in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer chart, and the overlay icon is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image167.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

### Task 4: Use Perspective View to create a simultaneous view of up to four unique queries

1. Select the Perspective View icon on the upper-right corner of the chart.

    ![Screenshot of the perspective view icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image168.png 'Perspective view icon')

2. Select the **Clone query** button in the empty panel to the right of the chart. This will create a new chart using the same query, making it faster to add related data.

    ![The Clone query icon is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image169.png 'Clone query icon')

3. Select the cloned chart to modify it.

    ![Two charts display (the original and the cloned) in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image170.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

4. Remove the speed terms, then modify the IoT Edge device terms (those based on the average engine temperature) by selecting **transmission_gear_position** under Split By. This should now be the only visible term.

    ![The Edge device terms fields display with the previously defined settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image171.png 'Edge device terms fields')

5. Select **Heatmap** for the chart type. It is easy to quickly spot anomalies in this view, where there are random hot and cold spots. This data is split by the transmission gear position so you can try and correlate engine temperatures with transmission gears.

    ![A heatmap displays in the Time Series Insights Data Explorer.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image172.png 'Time Series Insights Data Explorer')

6. Go back to the Perspective View to see these two charts side-by-side.

    ![In the Time Series Insights Data Explorer Perspective view, a chart displays on the left, and a heat map displays on the right.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image173.png 'Perspective View')

7. Select the **Save** icon to share the Perspective, give it a name, and save it.

    ![The Save icon is selected, and from its drop-down menu, the new graph is named Engine temp perspective, and is set to Share this Perspective.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-IoTandtheSmartCityimages/media/image174.png 'Save icon')

8. Now any users who have access to the Time Series Insights environment can view your saved Perspective.
